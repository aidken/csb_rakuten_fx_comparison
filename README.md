# Compare Rakuten Orders with FX Inventories

A simple web app of [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) that compares Rakuten order file with FX inventory.


### Plan

Currently this app receive inventory file and Rakuten order file and compares.

Rewrite and add more functionalities:

 1. First receive inventory file and show table. (Done.)
 2. Receive Rakuten order file and compare. If inventory is not enough, report. (Done.) 
 3. If inventory is enough, go to next step. Receive default picking location file (iwl.txt). If any item miss default picking location, report. (To do.)
 4. If inventory is enough, and everthing has default picking location, create BPCS macro files. (To do.)
